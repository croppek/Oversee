In order to install our system for your application, you will need a server on which to place the page.
It can be purchased at hosting sites or set up your own machine.

We need the server address, user login FTP and its password (all data should be included in the correspondence from the hosting company or in the admin server).

In any program to handle the connection to the FTP servers (eg FileZilla, WinSCP, SmartFTP or even Windows Explorer), type the previously prepared data.
After a successful connection to our FTP server just copy all the files from the folder Oversee-Systems server.

The next step will be to pass the address of the server (eg http://my-site-url.com) where the next steps will guide the installer of the system. :)

WARNING!

In case of a problem with the service inoperative subpages, edit the .htaccess file in a text editor by removing the second line, that is. "RewriteBase /".
Then save the file and overwrite the old file copying it to the server.
